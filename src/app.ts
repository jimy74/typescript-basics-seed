//LESSON STEP 1, arrow functions

const pizzas = [{ name: "Pepperoni", toppings: ["merguez"] }];

//arrow function:   (we can remove the parenthesis if et don't need the index, but for the example I leave it)
const formattedPizzas = pizzas.map((pizza, index) => {

  return n1 * n2;
}
console.log(multiply(2, 50));

const order = {
  pizza, //this is enough, it will add the parameter name and the value together
  toppings, //same here
  //pizza: pizza,
  //topping: toppings
};

console.log(order);

//LESSON STEP 4, Rest parameters

function sumAll(myMessage: string, ...myNumbers: Array<number>) {
  //here the second parameter is called a rest parameter
  console.log(myMessage);

//LESSON STEP 5, Array Spread Operator

const myToppings = ["bacon", "eggs"];

interface Pizza {
  name: string;

//with the prackets in the parameter zone, we say that we receive an object, and inside there is two attributs
//this is a good way to deconstruct objects easily and DRY the code
//see also that we can rename a parameter, and use strong typing
function getOrder5({ name: renamedNameParameter, toppings }: Pizza) {

console.log(getOrder5(pizza5));

//same idea with an array:

const [first, second, third] = toppings5;

console.log("A good breakfast could be " + second + " and " + third);

/*
Conclusion:

- Prefer enum rather than Union for values, especially for many pizza types for example (to DRY)
- Prefer interface than type, because it's extendable
- Prefer interface than tuple, because it's more understandable
- Don't re-type a well typed function with the general 'Function' type,
    because we lose some types safety checks, create a new type instead (reusable)!
- Never use the type any, if there is many possibilities try to enumerate them with the Union operator |
- Be careful with optional parameters, and undefined values, that might be set to '0' and still return false
- See the section for 'interface with index signature', super interesting to make evolutive / super dynamic data structures
- Classes in typescript are pretty cool and not boring at all anymore!
- Visibility in class constructor can generate the attribute, cool for DRY
- REALLY Never use String or Number, always string or number in lowercase (I know, not like in Java)
- Instead of enums, see the alternative with const, it's tricky but remains more understandable once transformed to JS,
    with the same benefits (when/if enums are added to JavaScript then you can move to the new enum syntax)
